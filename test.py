Just checking if my GPG signature works through this commit.
I'm not entirely sure how this reinforces my authenticity, 
since it looks like it's still gated behind a regular password.

Attempt 2: It looks like github already does some sort of default gpg
signature by default, so it'd be awesome if someone could explain to me
why this practice isn't totally obsoleted by this feature.

Attempt 3: Looks like I have to do this using git... I guess it's time for me to learn
how to use that then.

Attempt 4: Fine, i'll use git instead of github desktop.

Succesful signature: hey- looks like i never needed to learn how to use git to do this, awesome.
My brain was too allergic to learning bash in order to do so. Looks like I have to put my
password in everytime i commit now... ew.
