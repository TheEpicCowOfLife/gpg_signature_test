Just checking if my GPG signature works through this commit.
I'm not entirely sure how this reinforces my authenticity, 
since it looks like it's still gated behind a regular password.

Attempt 2: It looks like github already does some sort of default gpg
signature by default, so it'd be awesome if someone could explain to me
why this practice isn't totally obsoleted by this feature.
